ðŸ›¸ Autonomous Drone Swarm

Autonomous Drone Swarm is a Python-based Pygame simulation that demonstrates the core principles of swarm intelligence. This project evolves from a simple user-controlled player to a fully autonomous swarm of drones that dynamically navigate a 2D environment while avoiding collisions with each other.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

The project progresses in three stages:

Task 1 â€” Moving the Player

Create a player-controlled character in a Pygame window.

Implement smooth movement using arrow keys.

Restrict movement to stay inside the screen boundaries.

Task 2 â€” Adding Interaction

Introduce additional objects such as Enemies or Obstacles.

Implement basic collision detection between player and objects.

Add a simple outcome on collision (e.g., "Collision!" or game over).

Task 3 â€” Autonomous Drone Swarm

Transition from a single player to multiple autonomous Drone objects.

Implement the Separation rule from swarm intelligence: drones avoid crowding by steering away from nearby neighbors.

Refactor the game loop to efficiently update and render multiple autonomous agents.
